# Krucial
 
An E-commerce store on .NET API consumed by a React client.

- Used React, Redux, Typescript, AWS S3 for cloud storing images (credintials are in appsettings.json but it's git ignored of course) and a bit of small libraries.

- Demo will be shared soon enough or you can just clone the thing and run the API and consume it with the attached React project.
